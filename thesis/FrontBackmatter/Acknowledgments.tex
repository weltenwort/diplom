\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

The creation of this thesis would not have been possible without the help of
quite a few people. First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to my
lovely girlfriend Lisa, who lifted me up when motivation failed me and
supported me throughout my studies. Similarly, I'm grateful to my parents and
the rest of my family for giving me this unique chance.

I would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Alexa and Prof. Dr. Bickel for giving me
the opportunity to write this thesis. In addition, my thanks go to Mathias Eitz
for supervising my work and giving me valuable advice and feedback during its
creation.
