\chapter{Discussion}\label{ch:discussion}

The measurements performed above don't seem to lead to straightforward results,
that clearly favor one approach over the other. This might be explained by the
multitude of influencing factors, that can impact the performance.

\section{Structural Choices}

The intention underlying this thesis was to perform an evaluation of the
applicability of the Fast Discrete Curvelet Transform to sketch-based image
retrieval. It therefore seemed reasonable to otherwise choose methods and
algorithms that are frequently used in this area of research in order to
minimize the number of unknowns involved. The choice of edge detection steps
includes established algorithms such as the Sobel and Canny operators as well
as the recently published gPb contour detector
\autocite{arbelaez_contour_2011}. The simple sampling methods are designed
based on prior research, that suggests, that keypoint-based sampling barely
provided any advantages at the cost of increased processing and complexity
\autocite{nowak_sampling_2006}. Finally, the clustering and ranking process is
constructed using the often-used k-means clustering algorithm, several
established distance metrics and the TF-IDF weighting scheme, that has been
successfully applied to information retrieval for some time.

Based on the results displayed previously, one can conclude that an approach
based on Canny edge detection and local features performs better than global
approaches. The distance however, is not large and poorly chosen parameters can
lead to the global descriptors exceeding the local variants. This is probably
strongly influenced by the images involved in the retrieval process, as will be
discussed below.

\section{Parameter Choices}

Since many of the processing steps are based on commonly-used algorithms,
literature already presented reasonable starting values for the evaluation. As
the experiments in section \ref{sec:results_parameters} show, the initial
values already produce competitive results.

\section{Benchmark Dataset Choices}
