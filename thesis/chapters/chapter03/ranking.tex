\section{Ranking}

As the last step of the pipeline, ranking operates on the signatures produced
by prior extraction steps. It outputs a sequence of database images, sorted by
the similarity to the query image in descending order. The similarity can be
determined using various metrics and similarity measures, which have been
detailed in \ref{sec:anatomy_ranking_distance}. This section lists the metrics
used in the experiments and labels them for later reference.

\paragraph{$L_2$}

The simplest and most widely used distance metric calculates the euclidean
distance between the query image's signature and each database image's
signature.

\paragraph{HI}

When comparing histograms if features, the histogram intersection measure has
been shown to be superior to the euclidean distance in most of the cases
\autocite{wu_beyond_2009}. It has the added benefit of allowing for partial
matches in a signature.

\paragraph{EMD}
