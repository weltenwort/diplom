%OLD STUFF BELOW

%Most approaches can be characterized by looking at three stages in their processing pipeline:

%\begin{description}
    %\item[Input format] The structure of the input data determines the amount of information available to the subsequent processing steps. Possible preprocessing steps include color space conversion, scaling and edge extraction.
    %\item[Extracted features] Many algorithms produce a large number of coefficients that can be reduced to a set of feature coefficients using by techniques such as vector quantization or principal component analysis (PCA).
    %\item[Distance metric] In order to rank the images according to similarity a metric is used to calculate the distance in feature space between two sets of feature coefficients. The selection of a metric is often closely coupled with the feature extraction algorithm.
%\end{description}

%\subsection{input format}
%Complete vs incomplete sketches, intra-/cross-domain

%\subsection{features}

%\begin{itemize}
    %\item bag of features from k-means clustered visual words [video google]
    %\item histogram of oriented gradients [chalechale + refs]
%\end{itemize}

%\subsection{metric}

%\begin{itemize}
    %\item after ranking using euclidean distance, rank by spatial similarity [video google]
    %\item Earth Mover's distance? [rubnerljcv00]
%\end{itemize}
