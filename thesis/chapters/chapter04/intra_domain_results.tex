\section{Intra-Domain Results}\label{sec:intra_results}

As described in Section~\ref{sec:results_benchmarking}, the benchmark on a
dataset consisting purely of sketches is meant to remove the edge detection
preprocessing steps as possible biases. The pipeline configurations used are
the global LUMA+MEAN variant (Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline_global_luma_mean}) and
the local LUMA+PMEAN pipeline (Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline_local_luma_pmean}). As
the two graphs in Figure~\ref{fig:results_precision} show, there is a large
spread of precision values across the different categories. This is in line
with the observations made by the creators of the benchmark dataset
\autocite{eitz_how_2012}, that state that the images appear to be of varying
difficulty for computational classification. Here, for example, the descriptors
seem to deal with the "pear" or "donut" category well, and fail to categorize
images from the "cabinet" category to any significant degree.

        The graphs show results of applying the global LUMA+MEAN
        \subref{fig:results_precision_global_luma_mean} and local LUMA+PMEAN
        \subref{fig:results_precision_local_luma_pmean} pipelines to
        intra-domain retrieval of sketches. The areas indicate the overall
        spread of values across all categories while the line plots show
        results for selected categories.
