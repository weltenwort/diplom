\subsection{Global Features}

The processing steps applied to the database images and the query images in the
pipelines based on global features are almost identical, with the exception of
the CANNY, SOBEL and SEGMENT steps for the database images. The curvelet
responses are averaged on a grid and the features are ranked using the $L_2$
and the COS distance measures.

\paragraph{LUMA+MEAN}

The most straightforward combination of processing steps consists of a LUMA
input image, on which the means of $G \times G$ grid cells is computed for each
scale and angle (\autoref{fig:pipeline_global_luma_mean}).  Varying $G$
determines the feature size that can be encoded best. Setting $G=12$ seems to
yield the best correlation, although the advantage over $G=8$ and $G=16$ is
below $0.01$. The distance measure COS outperforms the $L_2$ measure
(\autoref{tab:results_global_luma_mean}). A possible explanation would be that
the COS measure normalizes the magnitude of the feature vector as discussed in
\autoref{sec:anatomy_ranking_distance_euclidean}.

\paragraph{CANNY+MEAN}

In addition to reading the images like in the previous LUMA+MEAN configuration,
this pipeline applies a CANNY processing step to the database images in an
attempt to bring the query and database image domains closer together
(\autoref{fig:pipeline_global_luma_canny_mean}). Again, the COS distance
measure produces the best rankings
(\autoref{tab:results_global_luma_canny_mean}).  Surprisingly, the Canny edge
detector does not lead to increased performance in comparison to plain the LUMA
preprocessing step.

\paragraph{SOBEL+MEAN}

The SOBEL step used in this variant also attempts to bring the database images
into the sketch domain (\autoref{fig:pipeline_global_luma_sobel_mean}). The
results are slightly better than with the CANNY preprocessor
(\autoref{tab:results_global_luma_sobel_mean}).

\paragraph{SEGMENT+MEAN}

With the gPb contour detector in the SEGMENT step to find edges in the database
images (\autoref{fig:pipeline_global_luma_segment_mean}), the $L_2$ distance
metric produces results comparable to the COS metric in the CANNY+MEAN variant
(\autoref{tab:results_global_luma_segment_mean}).  Unlike in the other cases,
the COS distance measure performs worse than the $L_2$ metric.
