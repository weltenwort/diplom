Experiment: Mean and Std. Dev. Features 1
=========================================

This experiment uses the following parameters:

scales
    4
angles
    12

The response images of the curvelet transform are divided into a regular 4 by 4 grid. The mean and standard deviation for every grid cell of every response are calculated.
